# Star Wars Characters

**Created:** 2.04.2021, **last updated:** 4.04.2021

This app allows you to browse all star wars characters based on [The Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/)

## Goals

1. Familiarize with TypeScript syntax
2. Further develop React skills
-  Use axios instead of fetch method to fetch data from API.
-  Implement infinite scroll with useRef and IntersectionObserver API.

## How to run this project locally

1. Clone the repository
2. In project folder open terminal and run:
    - `yarn install` to install dependencies
    - `yarn start` to run the app in the development mode
    - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
3. Optionally, you can also run:
    - `yarn test` to run tests.
    - `yarn build` to build the app for production (to the`build` folder).
4. Even more optionally, you can:
    - `yarn eject` - as the app was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) this is a script that allows you to remove the single build dependency. All the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint etc.) will be copied right into the project giving full control over them.
