## How to run this project locally

1. Clone the repository
2. In project folder open terminal and run:
    - `yarn install` to install dependencies
    - `yarn start` to run the app in the development mode
    - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
3. Optionally, you can also run:
    - `yarn test` to run tests.
    - `yarn build` to build the app for production (to the`build` folder).
4. Even more optionally, you can:
    - `yarn eject` - as the app was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) this is a script that allows you to remove the single build dependency. All the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint etc.) will be copied right into the project giving full control over them.

## Goals

1. Familiarize myself with the syntax of TypeScript.
2. Use axios instead of fetch API to fetch data from API.
3. Create a responsive layout.
